# Automated-DCGs---Capstone-Project-2024
This project focuses on implementing and verifying aDCGs for noise resilient ST-0 qubit operations. The project uses a Jupyter notebook created in VS Code, leveraging Julia packages like QuantumOptics, LinearAlgebra, Optimization, and Plots to perform and visualize quantum calculations and optimisations.
